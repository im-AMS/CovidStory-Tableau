# CovidStory-Tableau

## TLDR
access the visualisation [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aditya.ms/viz/TheCovidStory/TheCovidStory)
#### My Project 101 of Tableau with covid dataset.

I used the dataset from [OurWorldInData](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data).

The latest update of dataset was on `19 Apr 2022`

I used MicrosoftSQL Express in this project.

I loaded the data into the database, and used the right SQL queries to answer some questions about data.

I then created views for required queries so that I can load it into Tableau.

I connected the database into Tableau and created the required visualisation.

You can open the tableau file if you have Tableau Desktop Premium, else you could also explore the same visualisation on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aditya.ms/viz/TheCovidStory/TheCovidStory)
